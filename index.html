			<h2>Open Source Augmented Reality</h2>
			<p><em>OpenAR</em> is a free, open source resource for building lightweight browser-based augmented reality experiences. Our team is developing an accessible toolkit of trainings, templates, and tutorials for scholars who use digital technologies to study the humanities. <em>OpenAR</em> enables users with limited coding knowledge to create engaging, interactive AR experiences.

				<h2><a href="#">About the Project</a></h2>
				<p>
					<em>OpenAR: A Toolkit of Trainings, Templates, and Tutorials for the Digital Humanities</em> is a groundbreaking project designed to provide accessible, open source resources for creating web-based augmented reality (AR) experiences. Leveraging the free, browser-based AR.js library, the project aims to remove financial and technical barriers that have historically prevented humanities scholars, educators, and public practitioners from utilizing AR in their work. By offering customizable AR templates and comprehensive tutorials, <em>OpenAR</em> enables users with limited coding knowledge to create engaging, interactive AR experiences for research, teaching, and public projects. These tools will empower digital humanities practitioners to explore new ways of interacting with physical spaces, historical narratives, and cultural objects, without the need for proprietary software or app-based platforms. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The project will develop, test, and refine a suite of AR templates, accompanied by tutorials, similar in kind to those offered by <em><a href="https://programminghistorian.org/" target="_blank">Programming Historian</a></em>. The project will also offer specialized training modules and public workshops, in partnership with the DWELL Lab at URI, to ensure broad accessibility and adoption across the digital humanities community. All resources will be freely available online, supporting equitable access to cutting-edge digital tools for AR development. By eliminating cost barriers and making AR easier to implement, <em>OpenAR</em> seeks to democratize the use of spatial computing technologies, fostering innovative public engagement, site-based storytelling, and activist projects across the humanities.
